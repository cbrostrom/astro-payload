# Astroad

Astroad is a pre-configured setup for Astro and Payloadcms that makes it easy to get started with building your website. With Astroad, you'll have a complete development environment that you can run locally using Docker. This makes it easy to test and develop your website before deploying it to a production environment.

When you're ready to deploy the website on your own server, Astrotus comes with a production environment that requires the use of Traefik as a reverse proxy. This setup provides a secure and scalable production environment for your website.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Astroad, make sure you have the necessary software installed:

- Docker
- Node.js
- Yarn

## Configuration

While there's no configuration necessary for local development, deployment via Github Workflows requires specific secrets and variables to be set.
Secrets:

- USER: User on the server
- HOST: IP or URL of the server
- KEY: SSH KEY for connecting to the server
- MONGODB_PW: Password for MongoDB
- MONGODB_USER: User for MongoDB
- PATH: Path where the repository resides on the server
- PAYLOAD_PORT: Port at which Payload listens
- PAYLOAD_SECRET: String to encrypt Payload data
- TOKEN: Github Access Token for the webhook to trigger the payload.yml workflow and execute a new Astro build

Variables:

- ASTRO_URL: URL of the Frontend
- PAYLOAD_URL: URL of the CMS
- NAME: Name of the Container and Project

Please remember to set these secrets and variables in your repository settings to ensure a successful deployment through Github Workflows.

Once the secrets and variables are set on GitHub, they will replace the existing ones in the .env file on the server during deployment. This is done by the push.yml workflow, which replaces the placeholders in the .env with the actual secrets and variables defined in the repository settings. Please ensure that the names of your secrets and variables match with the placeholders in the .env file.

## Getting started

To get started with Astroad, you'll need to have Docker and NPM || Yarn || PNPM installed on your machine.

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/mooxl/astroad.git`
2. Change into the repository directory: `cd astroad`
3. Start the containers: `yarn dev`

This will start up the Astro, Payloadcms and Mongo containers and make them available on your local machine. Astro will be served at http://localhost:3000 and the Payload will be available at http://localhost:3001.

## Development

The `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose-dev.yml` files includes everything you need to run the containers. The containers use the environment variables declared in the `.env.dev` file and mounted volumes to store data persistently even after the containers are stopped and started.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled by a Github Actions Workflow on every push. It logs into the server via SSH, pulls or clones the latest version of the repository, and runs `yarn prod`.

Because Astro is completely static, a content change in the CMS must trigger a new build of Astro. Therefore, thereâ€™s a `payload.yml` workflow that gets triggered by a webhook after every content change from Payload.

Ensure you have Traefik set up as a reverse proxy before deployment. The prod script will launch your site in a production-ready environment.
